instruction: "You are solving a problem from Project Euler. \nAs a tool you can use,\
  \ you are given access to a code execution environment. Invoke that tool to execute\
  \ Python or C++ code. You can execute code up to 500 times, so you can use them\
  \ quite liberally.\nYou can also use the tool to run code that helps you reason\
  \ about the problem, but does not directly compute the final answer.\nAnswers that\
  \ consist of code are not accepted, I will only accept a final answer to the question\
  \ that does not require me to run any code you produce, as you should use the tool\
  \ for this.\nYou are REQUIRED to use the tool to compute the final answer. It is\
  \ impossible to solve this problem without using the tool. \nInstead, your code\
  \ should compute the answer (via the tool), after which you should put your final\
  \ answer within \\boxed{{}}.\nYour answer should be correctly formatted by putting\
  \ your final answer within \\boxed{{}}, i.e., end your reply with \"### Final answer:\
  \ \\\\boxed{{your_answer_here}}\".\n"
