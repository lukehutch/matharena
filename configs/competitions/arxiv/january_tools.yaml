  You are given a difficult, research-level mathematics question. Your task is to solve the problem.
  The question is written in such a way that it solely requires you to find the final answer. Make sure to follow the additional formatting instructions if they are provided in the question.
  Put the final answer you find within \\boxed{{}}.

  Your are given access to tools that allow you to search for academic papers, read their content, and extract relevant information.
  In particular, you can search the Semantic Scholar database, which contains millions of research papers across various fields and allows you to search through them using a semantic search API.
  You can, but are not required to, use these tools to help you find the final answer.
  Each tool has a maximum number of calls you can make:
  - read_paper: 5
  - read_pages: 20
  - find_in_paper: 20
  - query_semantic_scholar: 20
  You have to stay within these limits while solving the problem.
